Welcome! I am a postdoctoral fellow in computer science at Harvard University, where I am hosted by Professor <a href="https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Salil Vadhan</a> and co-hosted by Professor <a href="https://www.bewitched.com/" target="_blank">Martin Wattenberg</a>. I am also part of <a href="https://opendp.org/" target="_blank">OpenDP</a> and the <a href="https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Insight + Interaction Lab</a>. During the 2024-25 academic year, I was part of the <a href="https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/news/2025/05/crcs-closes-after-20-years" target="_blank">Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS)</a>. I am a 2024 <a href="https://risingstars-eecs.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT EECS Rising Star</a> and <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/rising-stars-in-data-science/" target="_blank">Data Science Rising Star</a>.

I work at the intersection of <mark>privacy & security</mark>, <mark>human-computer interaction</mark>, and <mark>visualization</mark>. Specifically, I develop human-centered tools that align technical approaches for protecting data privacy with how people naturally reason about data. Much of this work aims to enable privacy-preserving data science and AI by developing interactive visualization tools to make differential privacy usable. More recently, I have become interested in enabling privacy-preserving human-AI interactions, specifically in the context of conversational AI. 

I received a joint PhD in <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">computer science and communication</a> from Northwestern University, where I was part of the <a href="https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Midwest Uncertainty Collective</a> and advised by Professor <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/" target="_blank">Jessica Hullman</a>. During my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at Columbia University, a visiting graduate student at <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/datadriven2022" target="_blank">Simons Institute, UC Berkeley</a>, and a research intern at Microsoft Research in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate/" target="_blank">FATE</a> and <a href="https://socialmediacollective.org/" target="_blank">SMC</a>.
